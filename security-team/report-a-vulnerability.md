## Report a Vulnerability

We sincerely request you to keep the vulnerability information confidential and responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities.

To report a vulnerability, please contact the Security Team: [kmesh-security-vulnerability@googlegroups.com](mailto:kmesh-security-vulnerability@googlegroups.com). You can email the Security Team with the security details and the details expected for [Kmesh vulnerability report](vulnerability-report-template.md).

The team will help diagnose the severity of the issue and determine how to address the issue. The reporter(s) can expect a response within 2 business day acknowledging the issue was received. If a response is not received within 2 business day, please reach out to any Security Team member (listed [here](security-groups.md), under the `The Security Team` section) directly to confirm receipt of the issue. Weâ€™ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Kmesh
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Kmesh

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning Kmesh components for security
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related

If you think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Kmesh depends on, and that project has their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there.
